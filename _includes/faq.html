              <h4><i class="em em-rocket"></i> <b>What is a hackathon?</b></h4>
              <p>
                Think of it as a marathon of building and learning new things. Be it an app, website, or hardware hack, the sky's the limit! Anyone who has an interest in technology is welcome to attend this 24 hour event. The goal is to learn something new!

              <h4><i class="em em-sunglasses"></i> <b>What if I’m not experienced… Should I still apply?</b></h4>
              <p>
                Definitely! Whether it’s ideas, coding, design, or a really smooth pitch, everyone can bring something to the table. This is a great opportunity to learn something new, meet like minded people, and just have a fantastic time.

              <h4><i class="em em-clock7"></i> <b>Can I work on my hack before the event?</b></h4>
              <p>
                To be fair, everyone starts their hack only once the event officially begins. We recommend setting up your environment (install Xcode, Android Studio, Git, etc) but don’t start hacking until the event!

              <h4><i class="em em-computer"></i> <b>Will hardware be provided?</b></h4>

                Yes! A hardware lab provided by MLH will be available with Arduinos, Oculus Rifts, Amazon Echoes, and more! A list will be released with more details really soon.

              <p>
                Your laptop, charger, a piece of ID and your creativity! We also recommend bringing a sleeping bag and basic toiletries. Leave the rest to us! Breakfast, lunch, and dinner will be provided along with snacks and drinks.

          <h4><i class="em em-car"></i> <b>Will there be travel reimbursement?</b></h4>
          <p>
           Travel reimbursements may be offered depending on your location of travel. In your application, let us know where you're coming from and we'll let you know if you're eligible for reimbursement!

              <h4><i class="em em-scream"></i> <b>What if I don't have a team?</b></h4>
              <p>
                Don’t worry if you don’t have a team prior to the event, there will be plenty of opportunities to meet other hackers and form teams when you get here!
